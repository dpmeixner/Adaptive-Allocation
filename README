This project calculates the appropriate allocation for a factor investing
strategy. It uses average return to select a list of investments, and 
volatility to determine the allocation among those investments. It assumes that
investement allocation is updated on the 1st of each month.

Refer to the following link for technical details of how this allocation is calculated:

Historical data for each of the investments is collected from Yahoo Finance.

To use this, modify the variables located at the beginning of 
FactorInvesting.R:

tickers: The tickers of the universe of investments  to select from
timing_period: The number of months used to calculate the return for each investment
volatility_period: The number of months used to calculate volatility for each investment
backtest_period: The number of months to backtest this strategy. Set this to 1 to only calculate the investments for the upcoming month
assets: Total number of assets to hold in any given month

Using the default settings provided, you would see output similar to what's shown below. (The dates will change depending on when this is run.) As an example, for March 2022, the investment allocation would be:
31.54% EDC
58.41% TMF
10.04% URTY
